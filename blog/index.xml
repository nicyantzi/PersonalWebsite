      <description>I am going to start writing a blog. I plan on writing down my thoughts and ideas. I will talk about the books I am reading, the awesome stuff I am learning both in and out of the classroom during my MBA and anything that I find interesting. I am interested in data science, analytics, finance and consulting all while integrating technology. It is my hope that through this blog I am able to explore these areas in greater depth and share what I have learned with whoever would like to read.</description>
