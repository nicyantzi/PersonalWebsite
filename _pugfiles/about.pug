      p  Ultimately, I intend to leverage my computer science skills to help businesses make smart, data-driven decisions. In the past years, I've anchored successful teams at school, at work, on the court, on the water, and in my community. I'll bring that high-level leadership, drive, and ability to deliver to the next team I join.
